BRAIN ATTACK (STROKE)

Project description: 
Analyzing the available data set, our group intends to create a model to predict the likelihood of someone having a stroke,
as well as a program for our patients to input their information and get an predicted probability of having a stroke.

Data: 
Kaggle offers an original Stroke Prediction Dataset available for public access at the following web link:
https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/discussion/229886. 
Each observation in the dataset provides the relevant health information of an anonymous individual,
such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, glucose level,bmi smoking status and occurance of stroke. 
The dataset contains 5,110 observations with 12 attributes. Unknown or N/A imply that the information is either unavailable or not applicable. 
For this analysis, we will use occurrence of stroke as the dependent variable. Occurrence of stroke is implied by 1 for an individual who has a stroke, 0 for an individual who does not have a stroke.

Method: 
python : numpy,pandas, sklearn,matplotlib,seaborn,os,warnings,dmba
statistics: EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis),

Procedures:
1.Data Pre-Processing
2.Exploratory Data Analysis
3.Preparation for Model Building
4.Feature Selection
5.Comparison of Models
6.A Small Program to test people's risk to brain stroke

Outcome:
